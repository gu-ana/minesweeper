# Minesweeper

I've always liked playing minesweeper and since I got COVID-19 this lovely day I decided to pick up something I
enjoy playing and possibly implement some features I wanted.

To note: A lot of the skeleton code is from https://grader.dix.polytechnique.fr/agns/CSE101/TD13/2021/. The directions
were very simple to follow and I highly recommend checking out the other assignments to get a good feal of OOD design.

### Currently supports
* Chording (left click on revealed square)
### TODO
I plan to implement some features I really enjoyed from Spica's version of Minesweeper on iOS such as:

* Lucky first (First click will guarantee no explosive)
* Compile into executable using Cx_freeze or Pylauncher
* Customizable grid via menu using Tkinter
* Quick flagging mode (This is really only beneficial to mobile as there's no such thing as different types of taps)
